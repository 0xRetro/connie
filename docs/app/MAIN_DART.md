# Application Entry Point

The primary entry point for the Flutter application that handles initialization, service setup, progress tracking, error handling, and application lifecycle management.

## File Location
`lib/main.dart`

## Key Patterns & Principles
- Implements structured initialization sequence
- Uses dependency injection through Riverpod
- Implements comprehensive error handling
- Uses progress tracking with weighted stages
- Follows Flutter application lifecycle conventions
- Implements proper resource cleanup
- Uses async/await for initialization tasks
- Implements structured logging
- Validates environment configuration
- Provides global error handling

## Responsibilities
Does:
- Bootstrap the Flutter application
- Initialize and verify core services
- Track initialization progress
- Set up global error handling
- Configure provider overrides
- Set up application routing
- Handle initialization failures
- Manage application lifecycle
- Clean up resources on termination
- Configure environment-specific features
- Validate environment settings
- Track initialization stages

Does Not:
- Handle business logic
- Manage application state
- Define service implementations
- Handle UI rendering logic
- Process runtime errors
- Define routing logic
- Manage database operations
- Configure individual services

## Execution Pattern
- [x] Has Initialization Order
  1. Flutter bindings initialization
  2. Environment validation
  3. Progress tracking setup
  4. Logger initialization
  5. Core services initialization
  6. Service health verification
  7. Error handler configuration
  8. Application UI setup
  9. Lifecycle observer registration

## Dependencies
- `flutter/material.dart`: Core Flutter framework
- `flutter_riverpod`: State management
- `navigation/app_router.dart`: Application routing
- `ui/layout/responsive_layout.dart`: Layout management
- `config/theme.dart`: Application theming
- `config/environment.dart`: Environment configuration
- `services/initialization_service.dart`: Service initialization
- `services/logger_service.dart`: Logging functionality
- `config/provider_config.dart`: Provider configuration
- `utils/lifecycle_observer.dart`: Lifecycle management

## Additional Details

### Initialization Flow
```dart
1. WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()
2. Environment.validateEnvironment()
3. InitializationProgress setup
4. LoggerService.initialize()
5. InitializationService.initialize()
6. Service health verification
7. Error handler configuration
8. UI initialization
9. Cleanup handler setup
```

### Error Handling
- Environment validation errors
- Service initialization failures
- Health check failures
- Flutter framework errors
- Fatal initialization errors
- Resource cleanup errors

### Progress Tracking
Monitors initialization stages:
- Logger initialization
- Service initialization
- Health verification
- UI setup
- Resource cleanup

### Cleanup Operations
- Service cleanup
- Progress tracking disposal
- Resource management
- State cleanup

### Environment Features
- Debug banner in development
- Provider configuration
- Theme setup
- Router configuration
- Error handling setup
