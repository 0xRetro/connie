# Connie AI Assistant Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Initialize Dev Environment (branch: `feature/phase-1-init-dev-env`)

- [x] Set up project structure and development environment
- [x] Install and configure necessary dependencies (Flutter, Dart, etc.)
- [x] Set up version control (Git) and create a repository
- [x] Configure IDE (Android Studio, VS Code) for Flutter development
- [x] Ensure successful build and run of the base Flutter app

## Phase 2: Foundation (branch: `feature/phase-2-foundation`)

- [x] Implement core UI components and navigation
  - [x] Create the necessary directories and files for the core UI components and navigation
  - [x] Implement the main screen UI in `lib/ui/screens/main_screen.dart`
  - [x] Set up the navigation flow using a navigation library in `lib/navigation/app_router.dart`
  - [x] Create reusable UI components and widgets in the `lib/ui/widgets` directory
  - [x] Document the main screen, custom button widget, and app router in markdown files
  - [x] Create a `docs/concepts/` directory to store markdown files explaining core concepts and technologies

## Phase 3: UI Layout and Screens (branch: `feature/phase-3-ui-layout`)

- [ ] Design and implement the app's layout
  - [ ] Use a pre-built layout framework or library (e.g., Flutter Responsive Framework, Responsive UI) to save time and ensure responsiveness
  - [ ] Create a base layout template that ensures consistent sizing, spacing, and organization of UI elements
  - [ ] Implement the layout in the `lib/ui/layout` directory
- [ ] Create additional screens and integrate them with the navigation system
  - [ ] Design and implement the chat screen UI in `lib/ui/screens/chat_screen.dart`
  - [ ] Design and implement the settings screen UI in `lib/ui/screens/settings_screen.dart`
  - [ ] Implement a basic user profile screen in `lib/ui/screens/profile_screen.dart`
  - [ ] Update the `lib/navigation/app_router.dart` file to include routes for the new screens
- [ ] Implement necessary UI components and widgets for the new screens
  - [ ] Create reusable UI components and widgets in the `lib/ui/widgets` directory
  - [ ] Document the new screens, components, and widgets in markdown files
- [ ] Set up local data persistence using SQLite
  - [ ] Research and integrate a SQLite plugin (e.g., sqflite) for Flutter
  - [ ] Design a flexible and extensible database schema that can accommodate future growth and user-specific customizations
  - [ ] Implement a mechanism for users to modify and extend the data schema through the app's UI
  - [ ] Implement database operations (CRUD) for the required entities
  - [ ] Document the database integration and usage in markdown files
- [ ] Implement basic user authentication and profile management
  - [ ] Integrate a simple authentication system using local storage (e.g., shared preferences)
  - [ ] Allow users to create, update, and delete their profile information
  - [ ] Store user-specific settings and preferences in the local database

## Phase 4: Advanced AI and Automation (branch: `feature/phase-4-advanced-ai`)

- [ ] Integrate advanced LLM for improved contextual understanding
- [ ] Develop intelligent process automation and workflow optimization
- [ ] Implement smart suggestions and decision support features
- [ ] Enhance cross-domain data analysis and insights

## Phase 5: Extensibility and Integrations (branch: `feature/phase-5-extensibility`)

- [ ] Create plugin architecture for adding new features and integrations
- [ ] Develop API for third-party developers
- [ ] Integrate with popular productivity tools and services
- [ ] Implement user feedback and iterate on existing features

## Future Enhancements (branch: `feature/future-enhancements`)

- [ ] Multi-user collaboration and sharing
- [ ] Advanced data visualization and reporting
- [ ] Offline support and data synchronization
- [ ] Continuous improvement of AI models and performance
