# Services

The `lib/services` directory contains files that provide various services and utilities for the Connie AI Assistant app. These services encapsulate specific functionality and interact with other parts of the app, such as the database, API, or third-party libraries.

## File Structure

The `lib/services` directory has the following structure:

```
lib/services/
  ├── database_service.dart
  ├── api_service.dart
  └── ...
```

Each file in this directory represents a specific service or utility that can be used throughout the app.

## DatabaseService

The `database_service.dart` file contains the `DatabaseService` class, which is responsible for managing the interaction between the application and the database. It provides methods for performing CRUD operations on the database tables and handles dynamic table management.

For more information about the `DatabaseService` class, refer to the `DATABASE_SERVICE_DART.md` file in the `docs/app` directory.

## APIService

The `api_service.dart` file contains the `APIService` class, which handles the communication between the app and external APIs. It provides methods for making HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and handles the serialization and deserialization of data.

The `APIService` class uses the `http` package to make network requests and the `dart:convert` library to encode and decode JSON data.

## Other Services

The `lib/services` directory can contain additional service files based on the specific requirements of the Connie AI Assistant app. These services may include:

- Authentication Service: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- Notification Service: Manages push notifications and in-app notifications.
- Logging Service: Provides logging functionality for debugging and error tracking.
- Localization Service: Handles internationalization and localization of the app.

## Usage

To use a service in the app, you typically need to:

1. Import the service file in the Dart file where you want to use it.
2. Create an instance of the service class or use a dependency injection mechanism (such as Riverpod) to provide the service instance.
3. Call the appropriate methods provided by the service to perform the desired operation.

For example, to use the `DatabaseService` in a widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:your_app/services/database_service.dart';

class MyWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final databaseService = ref.watch(databaseServiceProvider);
    
    // Use the databaseService to perform database operations
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

When working with services in the Connie AI Assistant app, consider the following best practices:

- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and keep each service focused on a specific functionality.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for service classes and methods.
- Handle errors and exceptions appropriately within the service methods and propagate them to the calling code if necessary.
- Use dependency injection (such as Riverpod) to provide service instances to the widgets and other parts of the app.
- Write unit tests for the service methods to ensure their correctness and maintain code quality.

By organizing the app's functionality into separate service files and following best practices, you can create a modular and maintainable codebase for the Connie AI Assistant app.
