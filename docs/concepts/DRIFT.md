# Drift

Drift is a reactive persistence library for Flutter and Dart that provides a type-safe and expressive way to interact with databases. It is built on top of `sqlite3` and `web_sql` and generates Dart code based on your database schema, allowing for compile-time checks and autocompletion.

## Key Features

1. **Type-safe database access**: Drift generates Dart code based on your database schema, providing type-safe access to your database. This means that errors can be caught at compile-time rather than at runtime.

2. **Reactive queries**: Drift allows you to define reactive queries that automatically update when the underlying data changes. This makes it easy to keep your UI in sync with your database.

3. **Streams and Futures**: Drift supports both Streams and Futures for querying data, making it easy to integrate with Flutter's reactive programming model.

4. **Database migrations**: Drift provides a simple way to define and run database migrations, allowing you to evolve your database schema over time.

5. **Platform support**: Drift supports multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, and web, making it suitable for cross-platform Flutter apps.

## Integration with Flutter

In the Connie AI Assistant project, Drift is used as the primary database library for persisting and querying data. Here's how Drift is integrated into the project:

1. **Database definition**: The database schema is defined using Drift's `@DriftDatabase` annotation. This annotation is used to generate the necessary Dart code for interacting with the database.

2. **Data Access Objects (DAOs)**: DAOs are defined as abstract classes with methods for querying and modifying the database. These methods are annotated with `@Query`, `@insert`, `@update`, and `@delete` to specify the corresponding SQL statements.

3. **Database service**: A `DatabaseService` class is created as a singleton to manage the database connection and provide access to the DAOs. This service is injected into the widgets and other parts of the app using a dependency injection library like Riverpod.

4. **Reactive queries**: Reactive queries are defined using Drift's `@DriftDatabase.query` annotation. These queries return a `Stream` of results that automatically updates when the underlying data changes.

5. **Database migrations**: Database migrations are defined using Drift's `@DriftDatabase.migration` annotation. These migrations are run automatically when the database schema changes, ensuring that the database is always in sync with the code.

## Best Practices

When working with Drift in the Connie AI Assistant project, follow these best practices:

1. **Define a clear and consistent database schema**: Use Drift's annotations and Dart classes to define a clear and consistent database schema that reflects the data model of your app.

2. **Use DAOs to encapsulate database access**: Define DAOs for each table or related group of tables to encapsulate the database access logic and keep your code modular and maintainable.

3. **Leverage reactive queries**: Use reactive queries wherever possible to keep your UI in sync with your database and provide a responsive user experience.

4. **Handle database errors gracefully**: Use Drift's error handling mechanisms, such as `try-catch` blocks and `onError` callbacks, to handle database errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the user.

5. **Test your database code**: Write unit tests for your database code to ensure that it works as expected and to catch any regressions or bugs early in the development process.

By following these best practices and leveraging Drift's features effectively, you can create a robust and efficient persistence layer for the Connie AI Assistant project that provides type-safe and reactive access to your data.
