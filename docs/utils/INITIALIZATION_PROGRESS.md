# Initialization Progress

Manages and tracks application initialization stages with support for blocking and non-blocking operations.

## File Location
`lib/utils/initialization_progress.dart`

## Key Patterns & Principles
- Uses ChangeNotifier pattern
- Implements stage tracking
- Provides progress monitoring
- Uses immutable stage definitions
- Implements error handling
- Follows observable pattern
- Uses nullable types for errors
- Implements proper state management

## Responsibilities
Does:
- Track initialization stages
- Monitor stage completion
- Handle stage errors
- Notify state changes
- Manage blocking states
- Track user input requirements
- Provide stage information
- Handle stage ordering
- Support progress reset
- Manage error states

Does Not:
- Handle UI rendering
- Manage business logic
- Execute initialization
- Store application state
- Handle service initialization
- Process user input
- Configure services
- Manage navigation
