# Initialization Service

Coordinates application startup sequence, service initialization, and platform-specific setup.

## File Location
`lib/services/initialization_service.dart`

## Key Patterns & Principles
- Uses static utility pattern
- Implements sequential initialization
- Provides progress tracking
- Handles platform-specific setup
- Uses dependency injection
- Implements proper error handling
- Follows single responsibility principle
- Uses async/await pattern
- Manages environment-specific initialization

## Responsibilities
Does:
- Coordinate startup sequence
- Initialize platform services
- Setup database connection
- Handle migrations
- Check first-time setup
- Initialize preferences
- Setup analytics
- Track initialization progress
- Handle cleanup
- Verify service health
- Manage first-run state
- Track stage completion

Does Not:
- Handle UI state
- Manage business logic
- Define database schema
- Handle navigation
- Process user input
- Store application data
- Configure services directly

## Execution Pattern
- [x] Has Initialization Order
  1. Logger setup
  2. Platform services setup
  3. Database initialization
  4. Migration check and execution
  5. First-time setup verification
  6. Preferences loading
  7. Analytics initialization

## Dependencies
- `flutter_riverpod`: Dependency injection
- `initialization_progress.dart`: Progress tracking
- `database_service.dart`: Database operations
- `logger_service.dart`: Logging
- `environment.dart`: Configuration
- `storage_config.dart`: File system management

## Integration Points
- `main.dart`: Primary consumer
- `database_service.dart`: Database initialization
- `logger_service.dart`: Logging
- `environment.dart`: Platform detection
- `initialization_progress.dart`: Progress tracking
- `storage_config.dart`: File system setup

## Additional Details

### Initialization Stages
Blocking Stages:
- Logger (isBlocking: true)
- Platform services (isBlocking: true)
- Database setup (isBlocking: true)
- Migrations (isBlocking: true)
- First-time setup (isBlocking: true, requiresUserInput: true)

Non-blocking Stages:
- Preferences (isBlocking: false)
- Analytics (isBlocking: false)

### Stage Tracking
Each stage includes:
- Stage name
- Description
- Completion status
- Blocking status
- User input requirement
- Progress updates
- Error handling

### Platform Support
Platform-specific Initialization:
- Desktop: Feature setup, storage paths
- Web: Web-specific setup
- Mobile: Plugin initialization

### Error Handling
- Stage-specific error tracking
- Detailed error logging with stack traces
- Progress state updates
- Health verification
- Cleanup on failure
- Error recovery strategies

### Health Monitoring
Checks:
- Database connection and health
- Migration status
- Service health
- Platform services
- Resource cleanup
- Storage paths
- Default data

### Testing Support
- Mockable services
- Progress tracking
- Error simulation
- Platform detection
- Health verification
- Stage simulation
