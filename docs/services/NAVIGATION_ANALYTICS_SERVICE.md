# Navigation Analytics Service

A service that provides detailed navigation tracking, analytics, and performance metrics for application navigation patterns.

## File Location
`lib/services/navigation_analytics_service.dart`

## Key Patterns & Principles
- Uses singleton pattern
- Implements session tracking
- Provides performance metrics
- Uses structured logging
- Implements pattern analysis
- Manages timing data
- Uses periodic reporting
- Implements data aggregation
- Provides statistical analysis
- Uses clean data structures

## Responsibilities
Does:
- Track navigation timing
- Monitor screen duration
- Analyze navigation patterns
- Manage navigation sessions
- Calculate performance metrics
- Log navigation events
- Track user patterns
- Generate analytics reports
- Monitor session duration
- Aggregate navigation data

Does Not:
- Handle navigation logic
- Manage routing
- Process UI updates
- Handle authentication
- Store persistent data
- Configure navigation
- Process business logic
- Handle error recovery

  1. Session initialization
  2. Navigation start tracking
  3. Screen view monitoring
  4. Pattern analysis
  5. Metrics calculation
  6. Session reporting

## Dependencies
- `dart:async`: Timer functionality
- `flutter/material.dart`: Navigation types
- `logger_service.dart`: Event logging

## Integration Points
- `app_router.dart`: Navigation tracking
- `logger_service.dart`: Analytics logging
- Navigation observer: Event tracking
- Screen widgets: Duration tracking

## Additional Details

### Timing Metrics
- Navigation duration
- Screen view time
- Session duration
- Pattern frequency
- Response times
- Transition delays

### Pattern Analysis
- Common navigation paths
- Frequent transitions
- User flow patterns
- Screen popularity
- Session patterns
- Navigation loops

### Session Management
- Session tracking
- Duration monitoring
- Periodic reporting
- Data aggregation
- Session cleanup
- State management

### Performance Tracking
- Navigation timing
- Screen load time
- Transition speed
- Pattern efficiency
- Resource usage
- Memory impact

### Analytics Reports
- Session summaries
- Pattern analysis
- Duration metrics
- Usage statistics
- Performance data
- Navigation flows

### Usage Guidelines
- Start sessions explicitly
- Track all navigation events
- Monitor performance metrics
- Analyze navigation patterns
- Clean up session data
