# Setup Workflow Screen

The `setup_workflow_screen.dart` file contains the `SetupWorkflowScreen` widget, which is displayed when the app is launched for the first time. This screen guides the user through the initial setup process.

## File Location

`lib/ui/screens/setup_workflow_screen.dart`

## Description

The `SetupWorkflowScreen` widget is a `StatelessWidget` that displays a simple setup workflow screen. It includes a welcome message and a button to complete the setup process.

When the "Complete Setup" button is pressed, any necessary setup actions can be performed, and the user is navigated to the main screen of the app.

## Usage

The `SetupWorkflowScreen` is automatically displayed when the app is launched for the first time. The app's startup process checks the "first run" flag using the `AppPreferences` class, and if it's the first run, the setup workflow screen is shown.

After completing the setup, the "first run" flag is updated, and the user is navigated to the main screen of the app.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and functionality of the setup workflow screen by modifying the `SetupWorkflowScreen` widget. Some possible customizations include:

- Adding additional setup steps or screens
- Collecting user preferences or settings during the setup process
- Providing a more detailed explanation of the app's features and functionality
- Customizing the design and layout of the setup workflow screen

As your app's setup requirements evolve, you can update the `SetupWorkflowScreen` widget to accommodate those changes.
