# Logger Configuration

Configures and manages logger instances with environment-specific settings, file management, and rotation policies.

## File Location
`lib/config/logger_config.dart`

## Key Patterns & Principles
- Implements factory pattern for logger creation
- Uses environment-aware configuration
- Implements file rotation strategy
- Follows single responsibility principle
- Uses composition for logger outputs
- Implements backup management
- Uses consistent file naming conventions
- Implements size-based rotation

## Responsibilities
Does:
- Create configured logger instances
- Set up environment-specific outputs
- Configure log formatting
- Manage log file locations
- Handle log file rotation
- Clean up old log files
- Verify log file access
- Set up development/production filters
- Configure pretty printing
- Manage backup policies

Does Not:
- Write log messages
- Handle log levels
- Process log content
- Sanitize data
- Handle runtime logging
- Manage application state
- Define log message format
- Handle error reporting

## Execution Pattern
- [x] Has Initialization Order
  1. Environment check
  2. Output configuration
  3. Logger instance creation
  4. File system setup
  5. Rotation policy setup

- [ ] Has No Specific Order

## Dependencies
- `logger`: Core logging functionality
- `path_provider`: File system access
- `path`: Path manipulation
- `environment.dart`: Environment configuration

## Integration Points
- `logger_service.dart`: Primary consumer
- `environment.dart`: Configuration settings
- File system: Log storage and management

## Additional Details

### Configuration
Constants:
- Maximum log file size: 5MB
- Maximum backup files: 3
- Log file name: app.log
- Backup pattern: app.{number}.log

### File Management
- Base directory: {app_documents}/logs
- Primary log file: app.log
- Backup files: app.1.log to app.3.log
- Rotation trigger: 5MB file size
- Cleanup trigger: > 3 backup files

### Environment Settings

- Console output enabled
- Debug information shown
- Method count: 2
- Colors enabled
- Emojis enabled
- Development filter

Production:
- File output enabled
- Debug information hidden
- Method count: 0
- Colors disabled
- Emojis disabled
- Production filter

### Logger Setup
Pretty Printer Configuration:
- Method count: Environment dependent
- Error method count: 8
- Line length: 120
